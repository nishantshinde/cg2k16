<p>All the cities of a state (call it state1) are connected to each other via roads, i.e. pick any two pairs of cities, one can reach one city from the other one via some path. Two of its cities are the army base stations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>An enemy state (call it state2) plans to attack on this state but it can t attack on both the army bases of state1 simultaneously. Therefore, it wants to disconnect both the army base of state1 and conquer them one by one. This can be done by destroying some of the roads between the cities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Given a road network of the state, <b>find minimum no. of roads that need to be destroyed</b> so that the state is divided into two sets(non-empty) of cities which are not reachable from each other( or in other words, leaving both the base stations unconnected from each other). Each city can be expressed as an integer and cities with largest and smallest number are the army base stations.<br><br><br><br><br><b>Input Specification:</b>&nbsp;<br>Your input will be &nbsp;<b>string array </b>that contains &nbsp;List of all roads { list of integer pairs <b>x#y</b> : i.e there is a road from city x to city y }<br><b><br></b><b><br></b><b>Output&nbsp;Specification</b><b style="background-color: initial;">:</b>&nbsp;<br>your output will be <b>Minimum number of roads to be destroyed</b>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Example:</b><br>Consider the following road network(1 and 6 are base stations):<br>&nbsp;Input as a string array <b>{1#2,1#5,2#5,2#3,3#4,4#5,4#6} for this example.</b><br><br><img src="http://www.techgig.com/files/nicUploads/207xNx766550287371501.jpg.pagespeed.ic.V78qPSOKvy.webp" width="207" pagespeed_url_hash="365527441" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"><br><br><br>Destroying the roads (<b>4#5</b>) and (<b>3#2</b>) will disconnect the two base stations leaving no path to reach 6 from 1.&nbsp;But there is another better way possible to do so. We can disconnect 1 and 6 by destroying only one road(4,6) as shown below:<br><img src="http://www.techgig.com/files/nicUploads/214xNx355551831889898.jpg.pagespeed.ic.wethXu5WOt.webp" width="214" pagespeed_url_hash="3012710202" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"><br><b> Hence your answer should be 1</b> (minimum number of roads destroying which, two base stations can be disconnected).<br><br><br><br><b>Instructions:&nbsp;</b><br>1)&nbsp;<b>Do not write&nbsp;main&nbsp;function.&nbsp;</b><br>2) You can print and debug your code at any step of the code.<br>3) You need to return the required output from the given function.&nbsp;<br>4) Do not change the function and parameter names given in editor code.<br>5)&nbsp;Return&nbsp;type must be the same as mentioned in the problem statement.&nbsp;<br>6) When you submit your code, test cases of different complexity level are executed in the background and marks are given based on&nbsp;number&nbsp;of test cases passed.&nbsp;<br>7) If you do not plan to complete the code in one sitting, then please save your work on a local machine. The code is saved only when it has been submitted using Submit button.</p>
